# ComfyUI_Qwen2-VL-Instruct

This is an implementation of [Qwen2-VL-Instruct](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2-VL) by [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), which includes, but is not limited to, support for text-based queries, video queries, single-image queries, and multi-image queries to generate captions or responses.

---

## Basic Workflow

- **Text-based Query**: Users can submit textual queries to request information or generate descriptions. For instance, a user might input a description like "What is the meaning of life?"

- **Video Query**: When a user uploads a video, the system can analyze the content and generate a detailed caption for each frame or a summary of the entire video. For example, "Generate a caption for the given video."

- **Single-Image Query**: This workflow supports generating a caption for an individual image. A user could upload a photo and ask, "What does this image show?" resulting in a caption such as "A majestic lion pride relaxing on the savannah."

- **Multi-Image Query**: For multiple images, the system can provide a collective description or a narrative that ties the images together. For example, "Create a story from the following series of images: one of a couple at a beach, another at a wedding ceremony, and the last one at a baby's christening."
